### 1. What is Forex?

* What is Forex
  - Forex = foreign exchange, the global market for trading currencies.
  - Largest financial market (~$7.5 trillion daily volume).
  - Trades are always in currency pairs (buy one, sell another).
  - Spot forex (relevant to traders) ≈ $2 trillion/day.
  - Retail traders = ~3–5% of daily volume.
  - Market runs 24 hours, 5 days a week across global financial centers.
  - Decentralized & OTC (no central exchange).
  - Over 90% speculative trading (not physical exchange).
  - Very high liquidity → easy trade execution.
  - Advantages vs stocks: continuous trading, low costs, high liquidity, no short-selling restrictions, hard to manipulate.
 
* What Is Traded In Forex?
  - In forex, what’s traded is money itself (currencies).
  - Trading means buying one currency and selling another at the same time.
  - Currencies represent the economic value of countries (like owning a share in a nation’s economy).
  - Exchange rates show how strong or weak one economy is relative to another.
  - Profit comes from changes in these exchange rates (buy low, sell high).
  - 8 Major: USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD
  - AUD, NZD, and CAD as “commodity currencies“.
    
* Buying And Selling Currency Pairs
  - Forex trading = buy one currency, sell another (always in pairs).
  - Trades are made through brokers/CFD providers.
  - Currency pairs behave like a tug of war – price reflects relative strength.
  - 3 types of pairs: Majors: include USD, Crosses (Minors): exclude USD, Exotics: one major + emerging market currency.
  - Major pairs = most liquid and heavily traded.
    
* Forex Market Size And Liquidity
  - The forex market is bigger than all stock, bond, and commodity markets combined.
  - Daily forex turnover = trillions of USD, making it the most actively traded market.
  - High liquidity means tight spreads (lower transaction costs for traders).
  - Major pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD) are the most liquid.
  - Exotic pairs (like USD/TRY, USD/THB) are less liquid → wider spreads, higher costs.=
  - Liquidity is not constant → highest when London and New York sessions overlap.
  - Thin liquidity periods (like holidays or after NY close) can cause spikes or gaps.
  - For short-term traders (scalpers/day traders), liquidity is crucial to avoid slippage.
  - The size and depth of the forex market make price manipulation by a single player very difficult (unlike some smaller markets).

* How To Trade Forex-X
  - Forex can be traded in several forms, not just spot trading.
  - Main ways to trade forex:
      - Spot FX (OTC) – direct buying/selling of currencies in real time.
      - Currency Futures – exchange-traded contracts to buy/sell at a set price in the future.
      - Currency Options – right (not obligation) to trade at a preset price before expiry.
      - Currency ETFs – funds traded on stock exchanges giving currency exposure.
      - Forex CFDs – contracts to speculate on price moves without owning currencies.
      - Spread Betting – betting on price movements (available in limited regions like UK).
   

### 2. How Do You Trade Forex?

* How to Make Money Trading Forex
  - Forex trading = speculating on currency pairs (buy one, sell another).
  - Profit comes from correctly predicting exchange rate movements.
  - Always traded in pairs (e.g., EUR/USD).
  - You can go long (buy) or go short (sell).
  - Quotes include Bid, Ask, and Spread (broker’s profit).
  - Retail traders don’t trade physical money, but speculative contracts.
  - Most traders lose money (about 90%).
  - Success requires:
     - Education & knowledge of market.
     - A clear trading plan.
     - Strong risk management (risk small % per trade).
     - Realistic expectations (no “get rich quick”).
* Know When to Buy or Sell a Currency Pair
  - Buy/Sell Decision → Based on economic conditions of the two currencies in a pair (fundamental analysis).
  - Currency Pairs → Always traded in pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF).
  - Trade in Lots:
       - Micro lot = 1,000 units
       - Mini lot = 10,000 units
       - Standard lot = 100,000 units
  - Margin & Leverage → Small deposit controls large position; leverage magnifies both profit and loss.
  - Rollover (Swap) Fee → Charged/earned if a position is held overnight; depends on interest rate differences between currencies.
  - Avoid Rollover → Close trades before broker cutoff (around 5 p.m. EST).
* What is a Pip in Forex?
  - Pip definition: Standardized unit of measurement to express the change in value between two currencies.
  - Consistency: Pips create a universal way to discuss price moves, profit/loss, and spreads.
  - Non-JPY pairs: Pip = 0.0001 (4th decimal place).
  - JPY pairs: Pip = 0.01 (2nd decimal place).
  - Pipette definition: 1/10 of a pip (fractional pip), shown in the 5th decimal (or 3rd for JPY).
  - EUR/USD from 1.1050 → 1.1051 = 1 pip.
  - GBP/USD from 1.30542 → 1.30543 = 1 pipette.
  - 10 pipettes = 1 pip.
  - To provide more accurate quotes.
  - To offer tighter spreads (e.g., 1.6 pips instead of rounding to 2 pips).
  - More precise measurement of gains/losses.
  - Useful for short-term traders (scalpers).
  - Common pitfall: Confusing pips with pipettes (e.g., 135 pipettes = 13.5 pips, not 135 pips).
  - Pips = the universal forex measuring stick.
  - Pipettes = decimal refinement for more precise trading.
* What is a Lot in Forex?
  - Lot = standardized trading size in forex.
    - 1 Standard Lot = 100,000 units of base currency.
    - Mini Lot = 10,000 units.
    - Micro Lot = 1,000 units.
    - Nano Lot = 100 units (rare).
  - Leverage = allows traders to control a large position with a smaller amount of capital.
    - Example: 50:1 leverage → controlling $50,000 with $1,000.
    - Increases both potential profits and risks.
  - Margin = the amount of money a trader needs to open/maintain a leveraged position.
  - Profit and Loss (P/L) depends on:
    - Position size (lots).
    - Number of pips gained/lost.
    - Value per pip (depends on lot size and currency pair).
  - Risk: High leverage can quickly magnify losses as well as gains.
  - Lot size + leverage + pip movement = determines overall P/L.
* What is a Spread in Forex Trading?
  - Spread Types:
    - Fixed spread → Doesn’t change regardless of market conditions (usually from market maker brokers).
    - Variable (floating) spread → Changes based on market liquidity and volatility (common in ECN/STP brokers).
  - Major vs. Exotic Pairs:
    - Major pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, etc.) → very tight spreads due to high liquidity.
    - Exotic pairs (USD/TRY, USD/ZAR, etc.) → much wider spreads because of low liquidity and higher risk.
  - News & Events: Spreads can widen sharply during big economic announcements (like NFP, CPI, interest rate decisions).
  - Day Trading & Scalping: Traders who open many trades per day are more sensitive to spreads since it’s a frequent cost.
  - Carry Trades: Spreads matter less compared to overnight swap/interest, but still add to entry/exit costs.
  - Broker Transparency: Reputable brokers clearly show bid-ask prices and how spreads are applied.
  - Spreads = hidden cost of trading and directly impact profitability, especially for short-term traders.
* The Bid and Ask Price Explained
  - Bid Price = price broker will buy base currency from you → you sell at this price.
  - Ask Price (Offer) = price broker will sell base currency to you → you buy at this price.
  - Displayed in platforms: “Sell” button = Bid, “Buy” button = Ask.
  - Spread = Ask − Bid → your transaction cost and broker’s profit.
  - Liquidity impact:
      - Major pairs → tight spreads.
      - Exotic pairs or volatile markets → wider spreads.
  - Example: EUR/USD 1.10252 / 1.10264
      - Bid = 1.10252 (Sell)
      - Ask = 1.10264 (Buy)
      - Spread = 1.2 pips
      
* Impress Your Date with Forex Lingo
  - Major currencies = most traded and liquid; includes USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD.
  - Minor currencies = mid-tier economies (still traded but less liquid than majors).
  - Exotic currencies = currencies from emerging or smaller economies; high volatility, wide spreads, higher risk
  - Base currency = the first currency in a pair (e.g. USD in USD/CHF = how much CHF equals 1 USD).
  - Quote currency = the second currency in the pair; used to express profit/loss.
  - Pip = smallest standard change in a forex price (typically 0.0001, or 0.01 for JPY pairs).
  - Pipette = fractional pip; one-tenth of a pip, used when quotes include a fifth decimal (e.g. 1.23456 where "6" is pipettes).
  - Bid price = price at which broker will buy the base currency from you (you sell at this).
  - Ask (Offer) price = price at which broker will sell the base currency to you (you buy at this).
  - Spread = Ask − Bid; this difference is your trade transaction cost. E.g. USD/JPY 118.30/118.34 = 4 pips spread.
  - Cross currency pair = pair that does not include USD, such as EUR/GBP or EUR/JPY; often costlier to trade due to lower liquidity.

* Types of Forex Orders
  - Market Order: Executes immediately at the best current price, fastest execution but no price control.
  - Buy Limit / Sell Limit: Pending orders set to open long (buy) below the market or short (sell) above it, used when anticipating price retracement.
  - Buy Stop / Sell Stop: Pending orders to open a trade when price moves beyond the current level (buy above, sell below), used for breakout strategies.
  - Stop-Loss Order: Limits potential losses by exiting a position when price hits your defined threshold; becomes a market order when triggered.
  - Stop-Limit Order: Triggered at a stop price, but only executes at or better than your specified limit price, combines control and activation.
  - Trailing Stop Order: A dynamic stop-loss that moves with favorable price movement, locking in profits while limiting downside.
  - Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC): Your order remains active indefinitely (or until filled/canceled), unlike day orders that expire at end of session.
  - One-Cancels-Other (OCO) / One-Triggers-Other (OTO): Linked orders—triggering one automatically cancels the other, or one triggers secondary orders, used for combined entry/exit setups.
  - Order selection impacts trade control, cost, and risk management. Choose wisely based on strategy and execution needs.
  - Pending orders help automate entries/exits when you're away or focused elsewhere.
  - Advanced options (OCO, OTO) streamline combined take-profit and stop-loss planning—but depend on broker support.


 * Trading Order Types Cheat Sheet
    - Market Order → Instant execution at current market price; fast but no price control (slippage risk).
    - Limit Order → Buy below market / Sell above market; precise price control, but may not get filled.
    - Stop Order (Buy Stop / Sell Stop) → Activated when price passes a set level; used for breakout strategies.
    - Stop-Limit Order → Combines stop + limit; better price control but may not execute.
    - Stop-Loss Order → Protects against losses by exiting at a predefined level.
    - Trailing Stop → Dynamic stop-loss that moves with price to lock in profits.
    - Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC) → Order remains active until executed or manually canceled.
    - Day Order → Valid only for one trading day; cancels if not filled.
    - One-Cancels-Other (OCO) → Two linked orders; filling one cancels the other.
    - One-Triggers-Other (OTO) → Main order activates → triggers additional linked orders (e.g., entry triggers SL + TP).
  
  * Demo Trade Your Way to Success
    - Demo trading = practice without risking real money.
    - Only go live after proving consistent profitability.
    - Focus on one major currency pair in demo phase.
    - Trade demo for at least one month before live.
    - Demo cannot replicate real emotions in trading.
    - Start live with small positions to manage psychology.
