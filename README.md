### 1. What is Forex?

* What is Forex
  - Forex = foreign exchange, the global market for trading currencies.
  - Largest financial market (~$7.5 trillion daily volume).
  - Trades are always in currency pairs (buy one, sell another).
  - Spot forex (relevant to traders) ≈ $2 trillion/day.
  - Retail traders = ~3–5% of daily volume.
  - Market runs 24 hours, 5 days a week across global financial centers.
  - Decentralized & OTC (no central exchange).
  - Over 90% speculative trading (not physical exchange).
  - Very high liquidity → easy trade execution.
  - Advantages vs stocks: continuous trading, low costs, high liquidity, no short-selling restrictions, hard to manipulate.
 
* What Is Traded In Forex?
  - In forex, what’s traded is money itself (currencies).
  - Trading means buying one currency and selling another at the same time.
  - Currencies represent the economic value of countries (like owning a share in a nation’s economy).
  - Exchange rates show how strong or weak one economy is relative to another.
  - Profit comes from changes in these exchange rates (buy low, sell high).
  - 8 Major: USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD
    
* Buying And Selling Currency Pairs
  - Forex trading = buy one currency, sell another (always in pairs).
  - Trades are made through brokers/CFD providers.
  - Currency pairs behave like a tug of war – price reflects relative strength.
  - 3 types of pairs: Majors: include USD, Crosses (Minors): exclude USD, Exotics: one major + emerging market currency.
  - There are 8 major currencies but only 7 major pairs.
  - Major pairs = most liquid and heavily traded.
    
* Forex Market Size And Liquidity
  - The forex market is bigger than all stock, bond, and commodity markets combined.
  - Daily forex turnover = trillions of USD, making it the most actively traded market.
  - High liquidity means tight spreads (lower transaction costs for traders).
  - Major pairs (like EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD) are the most liquid.
  - Exotic pairs (like USD/TRY, USD/THB) are less liquid → wider spreads, higher costs.=
  - Liquidity is not constant → highest when London and New York sessions overlap.
  - Thin liquidity periods (like holidays or after NY close) can cause spikes or gaps.
  - For short-term traders (scalpers/day traders), liquidity is crucial to avoid slippage.
  - The size and depth of the forex market make price manipulation by a single player very difficult (unlike some smaller markets).

* How To Trade Forex
  - Forex can be traded in several forms, not just spot trading.
  - Main ways to trade forex:
      - Spot FX (OTC) – direct buying/selling of currencies in real time.
      - Currency Futures – exchange-traded contracts to buy/sell at a set price in the future.
      - Currency Options – right (not obligation) to trade at a preset price before expiry.
      - Currency ETFs – funds traded on stock exchanges giving currency exposure.
      - Forex CFDs – contracts to speculate on price moves without owning currencies.
      - Spread Betting – betting on price movements (available in limited regions like UK).
